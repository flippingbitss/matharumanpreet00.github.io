Wonderful Ann Arbor Colonial located in Hometown Village Sub! This home sits on one of the best lots in the sub. It backs to preserve land with a walking path into the woods. The lot to the left of the homes is also preserved land! Very private and views of the woods from almost every window. Close to Downtown Ann Arbor but with lower Scio Township taxes! Charming sub with white picket fences and a children's playground. This home is one of the larger elevations with 5 bedrooms, 3 full baths, powder room, office, great room, open kitchen and full finished walkout basement! The finished walkout basement takes you onto the newly refinished HUGE brickpaver patio overlooking the woods. Huge deck off of kitchen. House was remodeled in 2008. All appliances stay including newer front loading washer and dryer. Must see.....so much square footage too! Almost 3,500 finished square footage. Fantastic home in a fantastic neighborhood!
