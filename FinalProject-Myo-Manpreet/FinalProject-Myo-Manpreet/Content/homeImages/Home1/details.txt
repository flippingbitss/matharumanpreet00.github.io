A Robert Metcalf original located in the desirable neighborhood of Ann Arbor Hills. This home is surrounded by expertly designed Japanese gardens and a meticulously sculptured landscape.
One of only 68 Metcalfe homes in Ann Arbor, this custom built home exudes serenity and beauty. The attention to detail and meticulous upkeep of the home speaks to the owners love and respect of this homes history.
The kitchen is a chef?s dream with custom mahogany cabinets, Wolf stovetop, SubZero refrigerator, Virginia tile, colored concrete countertops, and a chef?s sink.
This home has been completely updated from top to bottom, inside and out, all of which have stayed true to its architectural design and integrity.
Updates include: an improved roof design by Metcalf himself with custom drain tiles, dual zone furnace (2013), lighting (2013), electrical (2013), resealed driveway (2015), updated bathrooms with heated tile flooring, plumbing, blown-in insulation, and $150,000 in landscaping architecture, design, and lighting.
I will be doing private showings to only serious inquirers, until August 29th when it is listed. Contact Cody Gale at 313-283-6262 or at SOLD@CodyGaleGroup.com
